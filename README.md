A) What is Dependency Injection?
   =============================
The process of injecting dependent object into target object using target class variable  / setter method / constructor is called as Dependency Injection.
Dependency Injection Types

1) Field Injection (variable)
2) Setter Injection (setter method)
3) Constructor Injection (constructor)
   
Requirement:

Develop an application to perform bill payment. It should support for multiple Payment options (Debit card, Credit Card, Sodex & Amex.... )

What will happen when we perform both constructor & setter injections on same variable ?
========================================================================================

-> First Constructor injection will happen then it will initialize the variable then setter injection will happen and it will re-initialize the same variable so final value be setter injection value.

Note âœ… : Setter Injection will override Constructor injection.

B) What is IoC ?
   =============

IOC: Inversion of Control

-> IOC is a principle which is used to manage and collaborate dependencies among the objects in the application.

-> In Spring, IOC is responsible for Dependency Injection.

Note âœ… : For IOC we need to pass Java Classes + Configuration as input then IOC will perform DI and it will produce Spring Beans.

Spring Bean : The class which is managed by IOC is called as Spring Bean.

How start IOC container?
========================
=> We can start in 2 ways 

1) BeanFactory (I) (outdated)

2) ApplicationContext (I) (recommended)

ApplicationContext ctxt = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(String xmlFile)

Creating First Spring Project
============================

1) Open any IDE

2) Create Maven Project

3) Open pom.xml file and add below dependency ðŸ‘‡

              <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
                <version>6.1.6</version>
             </dependency>


 Note âœ… : After adding dependency verify project Maven Dependencies folder (jars should be displayed)
 
 4) Create Required Java classes.

 5) Create Bean Configuration File like below ðŸ‘‡ 

          <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
          <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

          <!-- bean definitions here -->
          <bean id="credit" class="B_Payment_App_With_IoC_XML.CreditCard"/>
          <bean id="debit" class="B_Payment_App_With_IoC_XML.DebitCard"/>
          <bean id="sodexo" class="B_Payment_App_With_IoC_XML.SodexoCard"/>
          <bean id="payment" class="B_Payment_App_With_IoC_XML.PaymentService">
    
          <!--Constructor Injection-->
          <constructor-arg name="payment" ref="credit" />
    
          <!--Setter Injection-->
         <property name="payment" ref="debit"/>
        </bean>
        </beans>

 6) Create Test Class and start IOC Container.

        public class TestPaymentProcess {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context =
                new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Bean.xml");
        PaymentService paymentService = context.getBean(PaymentService.class);
        paymentService.pay(15000.00);
         }
        }

@ Constructor Injection will be represented like below ðŸ‘‡

      <constructor-arg name="payment" ref="credit" />
      
@ Setter Injection will be represented like below ðŸ‘‡

      <property name="payment" ref="debit" />

Note âœ… : "ref" attribute represents which object should be injected.

C) Spring Bean Scopes
   ==================
   
-> Bean Scope will decide how many objs should be created for Spring Bean class.

-> We have 4 types of scopes

			1) singleton  (default)
   
			2) prototype
   
			3) request
   
			4) session
   
-> Singleton means only one object will be created.

-> Prototype means every time new object will be created.

Note âœ… : request & session scopes we will use in spring web mvc.

       </beans>
          <bean id="apache" class="C_BeanScope_Example.Apache" />
          <bean id="glammer" class="C_BeanScope_Example.Glammer" />
          <bean id="washpoint" class="C_BeanScope_Example.WashPoint" scope="prototype">
          <constructor-arg ref="apache"/>
      </bean>
